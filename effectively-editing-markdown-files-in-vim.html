</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Writing markdown is not like writing code, or even HTML at times. Markdown is almost exclusively plain English and 
has very few tags and very little syntax, unlike HTML and all other programming languages. This puts Markdown in a
very strange place, since it cannot be edited effectively in a traditional word processor, and, it's structure
makes it a poor fit for many text editors. I played around with many different editors, including Sublime, Atom,
and even Visual Studio Code. The best fit was probably Atom, however, it's spell-checking is very inefficient to
use, or at least, I never was able to find a quick way to make corrections. This is perfectly fine, of course, Atom
is meant as a text editor for code, seemingly JavaScript,  where spelling is not important at all. But, I have the
English-language ability of a paper bag, and essentially require a spell-checker to not make numerous errors
without fail.</p>
<p>Eventually, I ended up back at my roots, so to speak, using Vim. However, Vim is also completely awful for Markdown
by default as well, however, I know how to configure it and there is a very robust community which has fixed the
vast majority of issues I encountered.</p>
<h1>Vimrc Changes</h1>
<p>By default, Vim does not recognize Markdown files as a filetype. This is fixed with a script later, but it is also
entirely possible to fix without the script by simply adding the following to your .vimrc:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>filetype on
filetype plugin on
au BufNewFile,BufFilePre,BufRead *.md set filetype=markdown
</pre></div>


<p>Now markdown files can be treated like any other file type. Personally, I added the following to make my markdown
edition experience more pleasurable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;&quot; Markdown
au FileType markdown set spell
au FileType markdown set autoindent
au FileType markdown set smartindent
au FileType markdown set list
au FileType markdown set lcs=tab:&gt;-
au FileType markdown set textwidth=115
</pre></div>


<p>There's nothing too fancy here. <code>spell</code> is simply enabled because I fail tremendously at the English language.
<code>autoindent</code> and <code>smartindent</code> are both enabled to make editing lists require less liberal use of the tab key.
<code>list</code> and <code>lcs=tab:&gt;-</code> work together to display the indentation levels when they are present. I find this makes it
much easier to determine which level I'm writing at in long chains of lists, which, often happens while I'm taking
notes. Finally, <code>textwidth=115</code> is something I'm still playing with. It forces Vim to start a new line once it
reaches 115 characters which is useful because it is very painful to edit extremely long lines. However, this value
will mostly likely change because 115 is a bit too small on a 1080p monitor, and, too wide for a split view on my
laptop's puny 1600x900 monitor.</p>
<h1>Markdown.vim</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown">Markdown.vim</a> is a script which adds proper detection of markdown
filetypes, adds syntax highlighting support, and, includes some features which some may find useful. It works
pretty well out of the box, however, a few small changes were required for me personally. The section in my
.vimrc is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;&quot; Markdown.vim
let g:vim_markdown_folding_disabled = 1
let g:vim_markdown_conceal = 0
</pre></div>


<p>The only changes above disable folding when a file is opened, which I find particularly obnoxious, and disables
 concealing. Concealing, in this context, hides the contents of a link while editing to save space. I actually
 haven't used Markdown.vim too much, so, I will do an article in the future outlining some more advanced features
 and customizations that I will eventually learn to use and decide on.</p>
